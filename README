NAME
    Catalyst::View::vCard - vCard view for Catalyst

SYNOPSIS
        # in a controller...
        my $profile = $foo;
    
        $c->stash->{ vcards }   = [ $profile ];
        $c->stash->{ filename } = $profile->username;
        $c->forward( $c->view( 'vCard' ) );
    
        # in a view...
        package MyApp::View::vCard;
    
        use base qw( Catalyst::View::vCard );
    
        sub convert_to_vcard {
            my( $self, $c, $profile, $vcard ) = @_;
        
            $vcard->nickname( $profile->username );
            $vcard->fullname( $profile->name ) if $profile->name;
            $vcard->email( $profile->email ) if $profile->show_email;
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This is a view to help you serialize objects to vCard output. You can
    configure the output filename by supplying a name in "$c-"stash->{
    filename }> (a ".vcf" extension will automatically added for you). A
    default "convert_to_vcard" implementation is provided, however you can
    provide your own to map your object to a Text::vCard object.

METHODS
  process( \@vcards )
    This method will loop through and call "convert_to_vcard" on all of the
    items in the "vcards" key of the stash.

  convert_to_vcard( $self, $c, $in, $out )
    This is a default implementation for converting your items to vCard
    objects. It will try various hash keys or methods based on the naming
    scheme of Text::vCard's methods.
